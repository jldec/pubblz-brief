Designs live in npm packages, created by experts using HTML, CSS, javascript etc. Images live in dropbox or the like.\n\nBy cleanly separating the source from the design, pubblz insulates content owners from the complexities of modern web standards.\n\nPreview a sample [presentation](http://jldec.github.io/roadmap/) or [documentation](http://jldec.github.io/pub-pkg-font-awesome/), or visit [github](https://github.com/jldec/pubblz-brief) to check out the source for this page..\n\n---- #box-pub-server ----\n\n# pub-server\n[pub-server](https://github.com/jldec/pub-server) is the technology underlying pubblz.\n\nComponents include\n- a static site generator\n- an editor\n- a web server\n\n**pub-server** runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). The generator and editor run in the browser, enabling instant preview.\n\n[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) content is stored in text files - ready for github.\n\nThe architecture is database-free. All code is MIT licensed.\n\nSee [doc](http://jldec.github.io/pub-doc) for more details.\n\n---- #box-npm-packages ----\n\n# Designs and Extensions\n\n**pub-server** leverages the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) javascript module ecosystem.\n\n**Developers** and **designers** can draw from the awesome [selection](https://www.npmjs.com/#home-stats) of npm modules to create new layouts, generator plugins, server plugins, integrations, and browser scripts.\n\nThey can then [publish](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=pub-server) their packages via the npm registry, to distribute their designs and extensions to **pubblz** users.\n\nExamples:\n[*this design*](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-brief),\n[documentation design](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-doc),\n[slideshow design](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-shower-ribbon),\n[icon package](http://jldec.github.io/pub-pkg-font-awesome),\n[font package](http://jldec.github.io/pub-pkg-font-open-sans/readme),\n[github integration](https://github.com/jldec/pub-src-github),\n[google authentication](https://github.com/jldec/pub-pkg-google-oauth),\n[authorize.net payments](https://github.com/jldec/authorize-net-dpm).\n\n---- #box-static-hosting ----\n\n# Static Hosting\n\nGenerating HTML at publishing time just makes sense!\n\nStatic websites are simpler, more secure, more reliable, more scalable and lower cost than database-driven CMS hosting.\n\nMany static generated sites are now hosted on services like [GitHub pages](http://githubengineering.com/rearchitecting-github-pages/), [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\n\nStatic hosting can be combined with CDN services like [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) or [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).\n\nReal-time interactions like authentication and payments can be routed to separate back-end services.\n\n---- #box-jurgen-leschner ----\n\n# Jürgen Leschner\n\n[github](https://github.com/jldec?tab=repositories) |\n[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jldec)\n\nActive in web, javascript, database, and content management technologies since 1996.\n\nfounder / co-founder\n- Pi with (acquired by EMC)\n- Collego (acquired by MRO)\n- Interactive Workplace (acquired by Siebel).\n\nEngineering at Microsoft, VMware, EMC, MRO, Siebel, Lotus.\n\nMIT - EECS, EAP - MBA\n\n---- #box-haydn-labs ----\n\n# Haydn Labs\n\n**Haydn Labs** incorporated in Delaware in January 2014.\n\nThe company is located at [CIC](http://cic.us/) in Cambridge MA.\n\nRegistered domain name **pubblz.com**, and  **pubblz** trademark in 2015.\n\n---- #box-end ----\n\n# Thank You\n![](/images/IMG_1273.jpg)\n"

This wiki repository is open by default for other GitHub users to edit -- something you just can't do with your `gh-pages` branch.\n\nGitHub Pages sites should behave the same way. Pages sites should have their own repo for the ouput HTML, with a URL in the same domain as the source repo.\n\nNow you could start doing things like hosting a staging site visible only to collaborators, or previewing a new generated site on your desktop before publishing it _!smile-o_.\n\n---- #box-1 ----\n\n## 1. https\nThese days, because of attack vectors like [ssl-stripping](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/), I would argue that any site with a form should be running over https. It's not enough for _only_ the form pages or post-urls to be encrypted.  And with [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication), hosting HTTPS endpoints has become relatively inexpensive.\n\n---- #box-2 ----\n\n## 2. generic form handlers\nCasual users don't require complex back-end services to handle forms for things like surveys and contact requests. Translating each form submit into an email, or collecting form-field contents into a spreadsheet is sufficient.\n\nMore complex multi-step forms such as those required for payments require custom-configured services (see proxy routes below).\n\n---- #box-3 ----\n\n## 3. private pages\nMarking pages or directory paths or an entire site as private would be a high-value, low-cost feature for GitHub Pages, and would serve many use-cases.\n\nDesign agencies could publish previews for their customers to try out, or companies could create internal sites on accessible only to their employees.\n\nSimple access control lists in a text file coupled with oauth would be a good start.\n\n---- #box-4 ----\n\n## 4. granular authz\nFor users to manage website content using 3rd-party tools with sites on GitHub Pages, those tools need to be able to write back to a GitHub repo without asking the owner for blanket write access to all their repos. 'Nuf said :)\n\n---- #box-5 ----\n\n## 5. more site generators\nLanguage frameworks like JavaScript and React are rapidly picking up momentum.  \n\nOpening the door for alternative [site generators](https://github.com/jldec/pub-server) to be run automatically when new content arrives in a repo (just like Jekyll) is important to keep the service attractive for developers who build sites with the latest tools.\n\n---- #box-6 ----\n\n## 6. proxy routes\nIn the past, mobile browser users were unable to see or block the traffic between pages they visit and 3rd party tracking services (or services posing as something else, but collecting data nevertheless). This era is thankfully coming to end.\n\nA better way for users to interact with websites they trust, is for *all* traffic to go back through the same HTTPS endpoint.\n\nThe role of a static hosting service in all this is to proxy those requests matching specific routes, and forward them to real-time services on the back-end.\n\n---- #box-7 ----\n\n## 7. online content editor\n\n> This is the elephant in the room when it comes to static site generators and  GitHub Pages.\n\nHow to enable non-technical users to maintain content on an existing site? Until this gap is addressed, GitHub Pages will be limited to sites maintained exclusively by technical users.\n\nThe solution suggested by the little [`Edit`](/pub/?page=%2F) button at the top-right is a start in this direction.\n\npub-server includes an editor+generator which can run in users' browsers, allowing instant preview without round-trips to a server.\n\nFor more information visit the pub-server repo on [github](https://github.com/jldec/pub-server).\n\n---- #box-end ----\n\n# Thank You.\n"

Pubblz already uses some fantastic libraries internally. Real **magic** is possible when developers start writing plugins.\n\n### service-partners and suppliers\nPubblz has been designed to leverage infrastructure as a service from providers like **Amazon** and **Cloudflare**, and will integrate with best-of-breed 3rd party services like **Stripe** for payments.\n\n\n---- #box-competitors ----\n\n# Competitors\n\n### [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/), [Wix](http://www.wix.com/), [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com/), [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/), [Jimdo](http://www.jimdo.com/)\nSaaS self-service website builders. Offer wysiwyg editing with professionally designed templates. Rapidly taking over lower-end web design and hosting business from agencies and even Wordpress. Profitable and spending heavily on marketing.\n\n**Limitations:** Proprietary, integrated CMS, limited extensibility, no self hosting\n\n### [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)\nWordpress is the dominant open source tool for website creation. Originally designed for blogging. Significant ecosystem of [themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/) and [plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) and hosting [providers](http://wpengine.com/plans/).\n\nDated architecture based on PHP and mySQL. Vulnerable to security breaches because of integrated admin/CMS.\n\n### [Google Docs]()\nGoogle Docs was the first to offer real-time co-editing features. Originally modeled after Microsoft Office with similar content types, import/export features, and print capabilities - now also supports forms, add-ons. Google docs is popular with [schools](https://www.google.com/intl/en/edu/).\n\n### Others\n[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/try-drupal), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [slides.com](http://slides.com/),  [cloudcannon](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/overview/tour/)\n\n\n---- #box-customer-relationships ----\n\n# Channel: pubblz.com\n\n**pubblz.com** will be the primary revenue channel.

Certain editor features also work better in an app.\n\n\n---- #box-todo ----\n\n# MVP - what's missing?\n\n### developer product\n- available today\n- requires command line, javascript, HTML, CSS and other technical skills\n- in production use at [www.fmctraining.com](https://www.fmctraining.com)\n\n### designer product\n- missing CSS and HTML editor, single-click installer\n- investigating plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/) (GitHub editor)\n\n### consumer product\n- missing consumer-grade UX\n- [Medium-style](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) wysiwyg editor\n- [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) integration\n- image asset pipeline - basic resize\n\n### awareness\n- missing early adopter marketing\n- developers and designers\n\n### operations\n- signup, [identity]() service\n- automated setup with CDN\n- devops, monitoring\n- documentation & support\n\n---- #box-end ----\n\n# Thank You.\n![](/images/IMG_1358.JPG)\n"
